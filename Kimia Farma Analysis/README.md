# Project Based Internship Data Analysis
## Background
As one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia, PT Kimia Farma generates a wide range of data from pharmacy operations, product distribution, and production processes. However, this data has not been optimally utilized to support quick and accurate decision making. Challenges such as data scattered across various systems, lack of integration, and inadequate analytical visualization drive the need for a more comprehensive data solution.

Through this data analysis project, the company aims to transform raw data into insights that can improve productivity and operational efficiency. The main focus includes monitoring product and pharmacy performance, understanding sales trends, and optimizing inventory control. With better analysis, Kimia Farma can increase its competitiveness, make more accurate strategic decisions, and provide more efficient services to consumers.
