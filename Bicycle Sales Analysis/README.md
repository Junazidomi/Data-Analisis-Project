# 99 Bikes Sales Analysis

## Background

The trend of riding bicycles for daily activities and leisure, the necessity for environmentally friendly transportation, and growing public awareness of healthy lifestyles all contributed to the rise of the bicycle industry in 2017. To stay competitive and maximize business strategies, 99 BIKES, one of the top bicycle shops, must comprehend sales trends and performance.

Bicycle sales trends, consumer preferences for brands, product categories, and customer segmentation were all determined by the 2017 sales analysis. This analysis also sought to assess sales contributions according to client attributes, time, and area. The analysis's findings are anticipated to serve as the foundation for strategic decision-making, including stock planning, choosing a marketing plan, and creating products that better suit customer demands.
