# Corn Production Analysis in Indonesia

## Background

Corn is one of Indonesia's most strategic and best-selling agricultural commodities. It is often exported and imported to meet the needs of the food and animal feed industries. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of historical data is needed to maintain the stability of domestic corn supplies. The analysis seeks to understand corn production trends from year to year, assess the area of production land, and identify the islands and provinces with the highest corn production levels in Indonesia. With this understanding, it is hoped that appropriate strategies and policy measures can be formulated to address supply issues and enhance national food security.

## Tools

The tools used in this project are a follows:

- Python Notebook
- Google Locker Studio
  
## Process

The Process in this project includes:

- Combine all dataset into a single dataset
- Identify the data structure such as missing value, duplicate data, type of data and create a data summary
- Perform preprocessing to improve the dataset, such as changing column data types, handling missing values and adding new columns based on available information
- Create data visualization using Notebook and compile dashboard using Google Locker Studio
