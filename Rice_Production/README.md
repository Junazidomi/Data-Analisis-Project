# Rice Production Analysis in Indonesia
## Background
Rice is a key commodity in maintining food sustainability in Indonesia. As the years go by, the population continues to grow, resulting in an increased demand for rice, which requeires an analysis of national rice production. This Analysis is necessary to determine the appropriate steps to take to ensure food availability is maintained. Several importand aspects that need to be considered include rice production trends in Indonesia, developments in agricultural land area, and the identification of provinces that are the highest rice producers. By understanding these factors, efforts to increase productivity and sustainability can be carried out in a more focused manner.
## Tools
The tools used in this project are as follows:
- Python Notebook
- Google Locker Studio
## Process
The process of this project includes:
- Combine all data into a single analysis dataset
- Identify the dataset structure, including missing values and duplicate data and create a data summary
- Perform Preprocessing to improve the dataset, such as changing column data types, handling missing values, and adding new columns based on available information
- Create Data Visualization using Notebook and compile dashboard using Google Locker Studio
## Dashboard Result
The reslut of this project were visualized using Google Locker Studio, and the dashbaord screenshoot is shown below.[Link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/ba73a5fd-f41d-4f77-87a0-ddb6eefd4d55)

Insight:
The graph showing the trend in rice production area (ha) each year shows that the average rice production area (ha) has decreased every year. This can be seen in the period 2018-2024 where ±30,000 ha has been lost. This can reduce rice production, which will have an impact on food security
