# Rice Production Analysis in Indonesia
## Background
Rice is a key commodity in maintining food sustainability in Indonesia. As the years go by, the population continues to grow, resulting in an increased demand for rice, which requeires an analysis of national rice production. This Analysis is necessary to determine the appropriate steps to take to ensure food availability is maintained. Several importand aspects that need to be considered include rice production trends in Indonesia, developments in agricultural land area, and the identification of provinces that are the highest rice producers. By understanding these factors, efforts to increase productivity and sustainability can be carried out in a more focused manner.
## Tools
The tools used in this project are as follows:
- Python Notebook
- Google Locker Studio
## Process
The process of this project includes:
- Combine all data into a single analysis dataset
- Identify the dataset structure, including missing values and duplicate data and create a data summary
- Perform Preprocessing to improve the dataset, such as changing column data types, handling missing values, and adding new columns based on available information
- Create Data Visualization using Notebook and compile dashboard using Google Locker Studio
## Dashboard Result
The reslut of this project were visualized using Google Locker Studio, and the dashbaord screenshoot is shown below.[Link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/ba73a5fd-f41d-4f77-87a0-ddb6eefd4d55)

### Dashboard Analysis 1: Average Rice Field (ha) in Indonesia

Insight:
The graph showing the trend in rice production area (ha) each year shows that the average rice production area (ha) has decreased every year. This can be seen in the period 2018-2024 where ±30,000 ha has been lost. This can reduce rice production, which will have an impact on food security

### Dashboard Analysis 2: Total Rice Production By Island

Insight:

According to the graph, Java Island dominates Indonesia's total rice production, contributing around 55% of the national total. Sumatra Island ranks second with a contribution of 20.7%. Meanwhile, Maluku and Papua Island contribute relatively little to Indonesia's total rice production.

### Dashboard Analysis 3: Annual Rice Production in Indonesia

Insight:

According to the graph showing Indonesia's total rice production each year, it can be concluded that rice production has decreased continuously. In the 2018-2019 period, there was a significant decrease of around ±5 million tons. Meanwhile, the total decrease reached around ±6 million tons. This condition can potentially disrupt the stability of national food security, so that handling and strategic steps are needed to overcome this problem

### Dashboard Analysis 4: Average Rice Productivity in Indonesia

![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Junazidomi/Data-Analisis-Project/refs/heads/main/Rice_Production/Picture/Dashboard%20Anlysis%20(4).png)

Insight:

Based on the graph of average rice productivity in Indonesia, it can be concluded that rice productivity fluctuates every year. However, in the 2022–2024 period, productivity showed a significant increase, especially in 2022–2023 with an increase of around ±6%.


### Dashboard Analysis 5: Indonesia Rice Production

Insight:

Based on the visualization of rice production maps by province, it can be seen that the darker the color on the map, the higher the level of rice production in that province. On the island of Java, the highest rice production is in East Java, Central Java, and West Java. Meanwhile, on the island of Sumatra, the province with the highest production is North Sumatra, and on the island of Sulawesi, the highest production is in South Sulawesi.
